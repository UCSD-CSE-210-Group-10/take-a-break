## Sprint Retrospective
**How did it go?**
- We mostly worked on integrating different parts of the application together. There were some difficulties in working on the project because all of the team members had other commitments such as midterms, quizzes, and job interviews.

**What went well?**
- Despite everyone having other school work and commitments (as it was midterm period), we were still able to meet 3 times a week to do the standup and work on the implementation together.
- As we did with all the previous meetings, we continued to set Agenda to every meeting which helped utilize our meeting time more effectively.
- We were more mindful of starting the meeting at the set time so there were no delays in starting the meeting like the last sprint.
- We’ve become more comfortable with resolving any merge conflicts which helped us to merge different branches to main smoothly.
- We were able to do some knowledge sharing during the meeting. The team member who already had experience in certain tasks (e.g., setting up the database locally) was able to help the other team members ramp up on those tasks.

**What could have been better?**
- Due to other commitments (school work, midterms, individual assignments, job interviews, etc.) we weren’t able to make as much progress as we wanted. 

**What will we do differently?**
- We’ll focus on implementing the code together for each meeting we have left.
- We can readjust the scope of the project so that the workload is manageable along with other commitments
