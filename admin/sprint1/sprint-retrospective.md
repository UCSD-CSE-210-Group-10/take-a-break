# Sprint Retrospective
## How did it go? 
- There was a holiday in between, and so a lot of developers were out for the extended weekend, and thus it was difficult to coordinate meeting times for some days. This led to slightly less progress for the week, though we still managed to make progress on almost all stories
- Because a lot of the developers were also learning the technologies along the way, there was also some developer stories we needed to finish before starting the user stories
- Github projects posed some challenges initially because we thought that the repository should be private.

## What went well?
- We were able to setup the database schema and create REST API for events
- We were able to setup the CI/CD pipeline on Github
- The login feature including the error popup for unsuccessful login is finished(no testing done yet)
- The UI for events page has been completed (no testing done yet)  
- We were able to make reasonably good progress despite having a holiday during the sprint. 

## What could have been better?
- We could have managed our times better since there was a holiday during our sprint and it was difficult to find time to work on the project during the long weekend.


## What will we do differently?
- In future sprints, the team will aim to manage time more effectively, especially when faced with holidays or long weekends, by planning ahead and allocating time to ensure consistent progress.
