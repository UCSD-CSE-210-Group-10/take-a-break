# Developer Documentation

## Introduction
The project leverages a modular architecture for efficient organization and maintainability. This section outlines the three core components:

- **Frontend:** This component encompasses the application's user interface, primarily built using React.js. The React frontend code resides within the `frontend` directory.

- **Backend:** This component handles the server-side logic of the application. It is implemented using the Go programming language. The Go backend code is located in the `backend` directory.

- **Database:** This component establishes and manages the application's database. It utilizes PostgreSQL as the relational database management system. The files pertaining to PostgreSQL setup are stored in the `sql` directory.

## Backend
The backend directory contains several packages used to construct our application. We provide a brief overview of each package

#### Auth package
This package handles JWTToken verification. It consists of two primary files:
  - `auth_handler.go`: This file is responsible for processing network requests directed towards the backend related to tokens.
  - `auth_operations.go`: This file houses the core logic for token verification. It contains functions utilized by the handlers defined in auth_handler.go.
  - Unit tests: Unit tests for the auth package are located within the dedicated `backend/auth/tests` directory.

#### Constants package
This package stores the constrants

#### Database Package
This package encapsulates the database interaction logic. It includes functions for setting up the database connection and performing necessary configurations. Database connection details are retrieved from the `.env` file located within the `backend` directory.

#### Events Package
This package manages event creation and retrieval functionalities. It consists of two primary files:
  - `events_handler.go`: This file is responsible for processing network requests directed towards the backend related to events.
  - `events_operations.go`: This file houses the core logic for event management. It contains functions utilized by the handlers defined in events_handler.go.
  - Unit tests: Unit tests for the events package are located within the dedicated `backend/events/tests` directory.

#### Friend_request Package
This package handles friend request feature. It consists of two primary files:
  - `friend_request_handler.go`: This file is responsible for processing network requests directed towards the backend related to friend request, including post and get friend request.
  - `friend_request_operations.go`: This file houses the core logic for sending, accepting, ignoring and fetching friend request. It contains functions utilized by the handlers defined in friend_request_handler.go.
  - Unit tests: Unit tests for the friend_request package are located within the dedicated `backend/friend_request/tests` directory.

#### Login Package
This package consists of one file:
  - `login.go`: The Go code in the "login" package implements user authentication with Google OAuth, exchanging an authorization code for an access token, verifying the user's identity, and inserting user information into a database. 
  - Unit tests: Unit tests for the login package are located within the dedicated `backend/login/tests` directory.

#### Models Package
This package consists of one file:
  - `models.go`: This file contains structs which define the data models used within the application, allowing for structured representation and manipulation of event, user, user-event, user request, and configuration data.

#### Frtiends package
This package consists of one file:
- `handle_friend.go`:This file functions for searching friends based on username or name, deleting a friendship, and handling corresponding HTTP requests. The code uses a PostgreSQL database, and the package includes handlers for searching friends and deleting friendships in a web service. The functions are designed to work with the "gin-gonic/gin" framework and utilize JWT authentication for user identification.
- Unit tests: Unit tests for the  package are located within the dedicated `backend/handle_friend/tests` directory.

#### User_event Package
This package managers the association between the user and the event. It contains handlers for inserting the user and the corresponding event into the `user_event` table in the database when the user RSVPs to an event, and handlers for fetching friends that are attending specific event that the user is looking at.
  - `user_event_handler.go`: This file has handlers for posting UserEvent to the database and also getting a UserEvent from the database. `PostUserEvent` function handles the POST request to create a new user event (RSVP). `GetUserEvent` function handles the GET request to retrieve a user event by email ID and event ID
  - `attendance_handler.go`: This file contains the friend attendance handler which handles fetching the specific users that has the friends relationship with the current user and are attending the specific event that the user is looking at. 
  - Unit tests: Unit tests for the users package are located within the dedicated `backend/user_event/tests` directory.

#### Users Package
This package is similar to the `events` package. It handles user creation and related functionalities such as making friends among users. It consists of two files:
  - `users_handler.go`: This file processes the network requests directed towards creation or fetching of users.
  - `users_operations.go`: This file contains the core logic for user management. It contains functions for making friends, fetching friends, and creating users.
  - Unit tests: Unit tests for the users package are located within the dedicated `backend/users/tests` directory.

#### Utils Package
This package contains utility functions commonly used in a web service application.
- `web_utils.go`: This file contains 4 utility functions - `HandleNotFound`, `HandleInternalServerError`, `HandleBadRequest`, and `SaveUploadedFile`. These utility functions help handle common scenarios such as handling errors, saving uploaded files, and providing appropriate responses to client requests in a web service application built with the Gin framework in Go.



## Frontend

#### Components
- `CreateEvent`
- `EventCard`
- `EventDetails`
- `EventsPage`
- `FriendCard`
- `Friends`
- `Login`
- `NavigationBar`
- `RequestModal`
- `UserProfile`
- `WelfarePage`

#### Auth Package
- `Login.jsx`: This file handles Google OAuth authentication, checks for and verifies JWT tokens, displays error messages in a modal, and provides a simple layout with UCSD branding and a Google sign-in button, allowing users to sign in with their UCSD credentials or Google account.

#### components Package
- `RequestModal.jsx`: This file renders a modal window displaying friend requests. It allows users to accept or ignore friend requests. The modal content includes the list of friend requests fetched from the backend API upon opening the modal. The component utilizes useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and handle side effects respectively. It communicates with the backend API to accept or ignore friend requests via asynchronous fetch requests. The modal closes when the user clicks on the "Close" button. Additionally, it handles errors related to authentication by invoking the handleLogout function passed as a prop.
  `navigationBar.jsx`: This component, NavigationBar, renders a navigation bar using React Bootstrap components. It consists of a logo of UCSD, followed by navigation links to different sections of the application such as Events, Health, and Friends. Additionally, it includes a dropdown menu under the "Student" label, providing options for the user's profile and logout functionality. The navigation links are implemented using React Router's Link component, ensuring smooth client-side navigation. The handleLogout function is passed as a prop to handle user logout functionality. The navigation bar is responsive and collapses into a toggleable menu on smaller screens.

#### Events Package
This package contains files to create and display events and event details as well as an wellfare_events package:
  - `CreateEvents.jsx`: This component is a form interface for users to input event details including name, date, time, location, contact information, and event description. It also offers checkboxes for users to select event tags like Physical Wellness, Cultural Exchange, and others, facilitating event categorization. Upon completion, users can submit the form to create the event. Styling is managed via CSS, providing a structured and user-friendly interface for event creation within the application.
  - `EventCard.jsx`: This component creates a single event's details in a card format, including an image, title, date, time, and host, with styling defined in an accompanying CSS file.
  - `EventDetails.jsx`ï¼šThis component displays detailed information about a specific event. It retrieves event data from an API based on the event ID passed through the URL parameters. The component includes functionalities such as displaying the event date, time, title, description, and venue, as well as an option for users to RSVP to the event. Users can see a list of attending friends, if any, and relevant event details like contact information, event host, and event category. The component also provides a back button for users to navigate back to the events page. Additionally, it includes a navigation bar for seamless navigation and logout functionality.
  - `EventsPage.jsx`: This file manages the display of all events with functionality for searching, filtering by tags, and rendering event cards with dynamic data fetching and user interaction handling. The `fetchEvents` function asynchronously fetches all events from the backend and updates the events state. The `toggleDropdown` and `closeDropdown` fucntions are responsible for the visibility of the tags dropdown menu for filtering events. The `handleTagSelect` adds or removes a tag from the `selectedTags` state for event filtering while the `handleSearch` function  searches for events based on the user's input and updates the search results state.
  - `WellfarePage.jsx`: This file manages the display of welfare-related events taking advantage of the `EventCard` to render events similar to the `EventPage`. As before, the `fetchEvents` function updates the events state with the events from the database. The `filteredEvents` function then filters these fetched events to ensure only the events tagged as wellfare/health are displayed. The `handleShowMore` toggles the `showMore` state to either show all events or a limited number (6 events).

#### Friends Package
  - `FriendCard.jsx`: This component renders a friend card displaying the friend's information, with functionality to send a friend request using a POST request, updating the UI based on the request's status.
  - `Friends.jsx`: This file manages displaying current friends, searching for new friends, handling friend requests, and updating friend statuses, incorporating modal interactions for request management.

#### Images Package
This package contains several images for frontend.

#### User Package
- `UserProfile.jsx`: This component displays the profile information of the currently logged-in user. It retrieves user data from an API endpoint using the JWT token stored in the local storage. The component includes the user's name, email, and avatar, which are rendered within a structured layout. Additionally, it utilizes a `NavigationBar` component for navigation and logout functionality, ensuring a consistent user experience throughout the application. If there are any errors during data fetching, such as authentication errors, the component handles them appropriately by invoking the `handleLogout` function.

#### Utils Package
